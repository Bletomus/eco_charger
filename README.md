# eco_charger

This was supposed to become a financial app that allowed people to pay with either econet or netone for their regular data bills and also, in the future, allow for users to make transactions with Ecocash and such. Too bad I live in zim and this project died early in development because...Zim i guess, do whatever you want if you find this code. If its useful to someone at some point that would make my day!
